# LabNPF_scripts

LabNPF_scripts is the official repository of the [Laboratory of Neuropsychophysiology](https://www.fpce.up.pt/labpsi) for data processing scripts. These include [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php), [ERPLAB](https://erpinfo.org/erplab).

Custom in-house scripts have circulated in the Laboratory since the dawn of time, but these lack consistent documentation and version-control. The purpose of this repository is to provide curated, version-controlled scripts.

The use of scripts to automate data processing tasks should always be done in a responsible manner, as scripts should not replace the researcher's decisions and judgment about data processing steps. 

Guidelines:
  1. When analysing any data, always ensure that you have a safe backup of the same data in another location. That way, if anything goes wrong and the data gets deleted ou modified during your analysis/processing, you can always recover the original data.
  2. Ensure that you know what a script does and how it should be used (read the documentation).
  3. Ensure that if you run scripts in a sequence, the sequence follows logical steps.
  4. Any data analysis or processing should be carefully documented in a log file so that every step of the procedure can be reproduced.
